1) Added webpack to dev
2) Added Start HTML
3) Added simple CSS
4) Added JS:
    - field input gets word-tag for searching images.
    - by click "Search" btn => makes http request (use fetch) to gets markup with images data (20 images).
    - by click "Load more" btn => adds to markup next 20 images.
5) Added slider lib "SimpleLightbox" for gallery.
6) Split js code into multiple files
7) Change code with async/await
8) Added the Axios library and modified the code with Axios to make the code simpler and cleaner.
9)Replaced functionality. Instead of the "load more" button, I made an infinite scroll. Used IntersectionObserver library to determine the intersection of the viewport and an empty div element. Splited code.
